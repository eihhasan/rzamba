              exciting project-based learning, school has become fun and

              projects that make us think critically and creatively, and read
              books we never had before. Through these projects, I've learned to
              solve real problems, work with my classmates, and express my ideas
              better. I've learned so much and feel more confident about my

              "During our Winter Community Classes, one of the parents,
              initially, did not understand our teaching method (Project-Based
              Learning or PBL). He believed that we were only doing drawing and
              painting in the classroom and requested us to assign traditional
              homework like writing and reading. For many parents, education is
              still associated with conventional homework assignments, such as
              rote learning through writing and reading.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              We took the time to have an open conversation with him to explain
              the principles of Project-Based Learning, including how it
              encourages students to engage in hands-on, real-world projects and
              creates a public product as part of the learning process. We also
              explained how this approach helps students develop critical
              thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Once he saw the progress and changes in his daughter's confidence
              and learning, he realized how effective and meaningful this method
              was. He apologized for his initial misunderstanding and expressed
              that this approach is far better than traditional methods. He even
              said that he believes all teachers in schools should adopt this
              teaching style.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              This experience was a powerful reminder of how important it is to
              engage with parents and share the value of active, hands-on
              learning. It showed how students can learn deeply and meaningfully
              through doing rather than simply memorizing facts."
